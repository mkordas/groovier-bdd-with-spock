# Groovier BDD with Spock

* typical Apple product: iPhone - one button, white cover and desperate people
 sleeping on the streets in front of iStores just to get one
* Google Search - one text box, one button, but of billions of searches every
 day and billions of dollars of income every month
* product that we work on - lots of buttons, weird logic, complexity, mess...

But it's not the worst case...
At least you could see that and run away early enough.
In my work I deal with applications without any UI, so the complexity is hidden
and you need a few months to learn about it.

On the other hand, this is not a rocket science.
We're not sending any rockets to the moon.
Majority of our applications just contain a hell lot of ifs, loops,
data processing and that's it.
All the algorithms I needed to use in my applications were already written by
someone else.
Software development is nowadays just like building blocks.
It's not the hardcore algorithm hacking as it used to be before.

Life is simple, right? Not really. We all know that picture...

My question is: is it because problem with technology?
Is it because they chose Java Script as the programming language?
I wouldn't say so.
It's all about people's problem and communication issues.

Actually, there's just one problem in software development...
It's **to understand the problem**.
