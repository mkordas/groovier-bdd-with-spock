# Groovier BDD with Spock

* iPhone - one button, white cover and desperate people sleeping on the streets
 in front of iStores just to get one
* Google Search - one text box, one button, but of billions of searches every
 day and billions of dollars of income every month
* product that we work on - lots of buttons, weird logic, complexity, mess...

But it's not the worst case...
At least you could see that and run away early enough.
In my work I deal with applications without any UI, so the complexity is hidden.
