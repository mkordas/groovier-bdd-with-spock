Good afternoon Topconf!
I'm so glad to see you all here.

How was the lunch? Was it good? Nice!

My name is Michal and I'm a software quality engineer in Luxoft Poland.
I do everything that is necessary to deliver with quality
including embedding quality in entire process and people's minds,
so it's not just testing.
Moreover I'm a trainer in Luxoft Training. I teach Java and agile software
development.

Today I have presentation about BDD, Groovy and Spock.
